*.txt files contain data for panels selected for screen display. These contain S11 mag & phase, and impedances R & X.

Columnar data begin on line 23.

File naming convention:

<antenna ID>.<load>.<series no.>.<file type>

antenna ID:  last digit of the antenna number and signal path ID (A/B).
load:        47 pF capacitor, 66 pF capacitor, 19.46 ohm resistor,

series no.:  For measurements, a sequential number.
             For reference sources, indicates between which measurements 
             the data was acquired, e.g., <X-Y>= "1-2." for m1 and m2
