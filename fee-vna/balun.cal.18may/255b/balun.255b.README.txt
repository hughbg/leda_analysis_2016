*.txt files contain data for panels selected for screen display. These contain S11 mag & phase, and impedances R & X.

Columnar data begin on line 23.

File naming convention:

<antenna ID>.<load>.<series no.>.<file type>

antenna ID:  last digit of the antenna number and signal path ID (A/B).
load:        47 pF capacitor, 66 pF capacitor, 19.46 ohm resistor,
             49.99 ohm resistor, or 194.65 ohm resistor.
series no.:  For measurements, sequential number.
             For reference sources, indicates between which measurements 
             the data was acquired, e.g., <X-Y>= "1-2." for m1 and m2             
             the data was acquired, e.g., <X.Y.>= "1.2." for m1 and m2
file type:   .txt or .s2p
