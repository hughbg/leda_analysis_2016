Block of scans begin and end with Y-factor determination.

Measurements with 5 loads (R,C) are obtained for each of two reference cables, 0.9m (3') and 2.0m. 12" flex cables between the reference plane of the VNA (the end of the ruggedized cable to which cal key  are applied) and the FE board are denoted UU for A sides (in place of TOP, which failed) and BOT for B sides.

The 12", 0.9m, and 2m cables are calibrated w/ results appearing in SMB-cables.edt.ljg.xlsx .

Raw data below is stored in 

ledaovro:/nfs/jbod00/spec_dump/<starttime> .  Only data acquired within 60s of the start time has a defined instrument state.  Within each directory is data for EVERY dipole.  Only ONE is rigged for noise parameters measurement.  The others should be ignored.  For the one antenna of interest, there are files for SKY, LOAD, and DIODE referring to  SW0, COLD, and HOT paths.
